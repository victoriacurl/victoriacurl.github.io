I've been tasked with answering the question of "Why did you decide to learn software development?" and the answer for me is pretty simple. I enjoy it. That's the black and white answer but if we dive into it there's more than that. I view Software Development at its core as a puzzle. For someone like me, who has an incredibly analytical mind, a career path that challenges and rewards me at the end is ideal because it keeps my mind occupied and interested. It's everything I could ask for and so when my father introduced me to Flatiron it seemed to all fit together.

I'm excited to be passionate about what I'm doing and to see the ways it can change things in the world around us. That's the more colorful answer. It's also the one that I enjoy telling people more because I like seeing people think about Software Development as more than just some guy sitting behind a screen in the dark writing code alone just so he can hack into some website.
